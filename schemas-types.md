# Schemas and Types

Schemas and Types in GraphQL: Schemas and types are the building blocks of a GraphQL API. A schema defines the structure of the data that can be queried, while a type defines the structure of a single piece of data. In GraphQL, types are used to define the structure of the data, and schemas are used to define the relationships between types.
