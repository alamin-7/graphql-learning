# Subscriptions

Subscriptions in GraphQL: Subscriptions are used to establish a real-time connection between the client and server. They allow the client to receive updates from the server as soon as the data changes. Subscriptions are useful for applications that require real-time updates, such as live scores, live updates, or live chat.
